The main goal here is to create a “guess the word” game. As simple as it sounds, it has certain key things 
you need to note. 

# The user should input the length of the word. [3, 4, 5, 6]
# input("Enter the length of the word [3-6] : ")

# Use a text file to store a group of words. You’ll need a way to grab a word of given length at random to use 
for guessing.
Hint: Use random function / choice function


# The user needs to be able to input letter guesses. (Single letter guesses / not numbers )

# Keep notifying the user of the remaining number of turns/attempts.

# You will also need functions to check if the user input is actually a single letter, to check if
the input letter is in the hidden word (and if it is, how many times it appears), to print letters, 
and a counter variable to limit guesses.

** Mandatory to use atleast 2 functions.

# Characters have to be case insensitive (letter a and A should be considered as same)
Same guesses should not be considered. (No deduction in attempts left)
Hint: "You already guessed this letter, please try another letter"

# A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use.
Number of attempts should be (2 * length of word)-2

# Correct attempt/guess will not reduce the number of attempts left.

# ** Mandatory:
If the number of attempts/guesses are exhausted (0), then reveal the word to the user and ask the user if he wants to 
   play again, Y/N . If Y, restart the game and query for the word length else quit.

# Keep track of all the "incorrect" attempts of the user and display them at each iteration.
