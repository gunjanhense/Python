Task 1:

Create a class named Shape with two attributes x and y. Define two methods namely area and perimeter,
to calculate the area and perimeter of the shape using the below formulae.
area = x * y
perimeter = 2*x + 2*y

Task 2:
Create another class named Rectangle which also accepts two attributes x, y and inherits the Shape class.
Create an object of the Rectangle class and calculate the area and perimeter of the created rectangle object.

Task 3:
Write a function which reverses the characters of a word passed as argument. The function should return 
a generator object and iterating over that generator object should return each character in the reverse
order.
