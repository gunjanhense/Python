				      Deadline : 21st of Oct 2020


Task 1:

text = ["Life is always beautiful", "No need to overthink", "Meditation helps in overcoming your depression"]

	Remove these words ‘always’, ‘in’, ‘to’, ‘no’, 'your' from text list.

Expected Output: ["Life is beautiful", "need overthink", "Meditation helps overcoming depression"]


Task 2:

Use a list comprehension to create and print a list of even numbers starting with 2 
and ending with 200 which are divisible by 5. (both 2 and 200 inclusive)

Task 3:

You are given three integers x,y,z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. 
You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i, j, k) on a 3D grid where the 
sum of i, j, k is not equal to n.

Consider 0<=i<=x , 0<=j<=y, 0<=k<=z

Input Format: Four integers (x, y, z, n) separated by comma.

Constraints: Print the list in lexicographic decreasing order.

Example:
Input: 
1, 1, 1, 2

Output:
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
or
[(1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0)]

Hint: Easy if you use comprehension concept.
